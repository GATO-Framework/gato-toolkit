# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug 🐞
- Discussing the current state of the code 💬
- Submitting a fix 🛠
- Proposing new features 💡

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes. (We don't have tests yet 😔)
5. Make sure your code lints. (Eventually ⏳ we'll add some pre-commit steps)
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/FyZyX/gato-toolkit-ui/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/FyZyX/gato-toolkit-ui/issuess/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background 📝
- Steps to reproduce ☑
- Be specific 🕵️‍♂️
- Give sample code if you can 💻
- What you expected would happen 🏝
- What actually happens 🌋
